The system is set up as two VHDL libraries, LibNeuron and LibElegans.

The compile order of LibNeuron should be as follows:
Typedefinitions.vhd
Timer.vhd
Threshold.vhd
BurstBlock.vhd
Oscillator.vhd
Neuron1.vhd
Neuron2.vhd
Synapse.vhd
Synapse_Adv.vhd

LibElegans needs LibNeuron to compile, the files should be compiled in this order:
Neuron_Types.vhd
Synapse_Types.vhd
DriverNeuron_Types.vhd
Loco_Unit.vhd
C_ElegansLoco.vhd (TOP LEVEL MODULE).

Two testbenches are included in LibElegans. 
TB_ElegansLoco.vhd runs a simple forward-backwards pattern. Run this for 20 seconds.
TB_ElegansLoco2.vhd runs a simple coiling motion. Run for 15 seconds although less probably needed.

The C.Elegans top level:
INPUTS:
Clock - 1MHz Clock for Real-time
nReset - Async Active-low reset
CKE    - Active High Clock Enable. Allows the model to be paused.
NR_ON  - Enables Forward Movement
TS_ON  - Enables Backward Movement
COIL_ON - Enables Coiling
OUTPUTS:
NRD/NRV - Nerve ring driver outputs on dorsal and ventral sides
AVA     - Pattern pacer neuron for reverse locomotion
AVB     - Pattern Pacer neuron for forward locomotion
MSCD    - Motor neuron (Muscle) output on dorsal side (from head to tail)
MSCV    - As above but ventral side
TSD/TSV - Tail Section driver outputs on dorsal and ventral sides.
